The research have several login formats possible but it does't have only user or 
only email login as its just same. These are ways to show error massage those 
are implemented and i write them to let myself remember that technical world
is wast and based on creativity and knowledge of using right thing at right time.

Note: the jsp pages depend on servlet so they might not work same way because
they need dedicated servlet for their dedicated goals. 

The 4th Login page is't final but it holds all the require data to learn from it,
about: ajax, capturing servlet data and add into tag, basic validation method
(which is removed from primary login) and a-lot of stuff more.
